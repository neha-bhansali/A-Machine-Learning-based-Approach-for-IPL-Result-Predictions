# A Machine Learning approach towards predicting IPL game outcomes based on Team Performance

The Indian Premier League (IPL) has become an integral component of modern cricket, 
intertwining with the financial market to create a dynamic environment where predicting match 
winners holds immeasurable significance. With an enormous viewership and increase in wagering 
platforms, accurate predictions have become crucial for investors, businesses, and broadcasters, 
exploring to capitalize on the IPL's economic potential. Also being able to foresee the results 
beforehand would provide valuable insights to the players, team, and coaches, enabling them to 
identify specific areas for improvement and enhance their performance in the match. 
By utilizing advanced statistical and machine learning techniques, our research aims to bridge the 
gap between sports analytics and financial strategy in a dynamic environment by predicting the 
winning team of an IPL match in the second innings of a cricket match. The prediction is made by 
training a robust predictive model capable of enhancing the accuracy of match result forecasts. For 
this purpose, a model is developed using Ensemble Learning to test and train datasets of all past 
IPL matches. By utilizing previous match data encompassing multiple aspects such as venue, 
teams, targets, and wickets, our model strives to give insights into the potential outcomes of the 
upcoming IPL matches
